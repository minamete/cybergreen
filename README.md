# Cybergreen

# Getting Started
For this web app to work, both the frontend and the backend must be running.

## Frontend
1. Change into `cybergreen_frontend`
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run start`

## Backend
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. If you're on a Mac ARM processor and getting a ModuleNotFound error with `openai`, try `export PATH=“/git/openai-quickstart-python:${PATH}”`.
2. Run `python app.py`
